      <p> At Little Hearts, we believe that early childhood is the most crucial stage 
      of development—where young minds bloom with curiosity, imagination, and boundless potential. 
      Our preschool is built on a foundation of love, faith, and a deep respect for every child’s unique journey.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We strive to provide a nurturing, joyful, and engaging environment where children feel safe, valued, 
    and excited to learn. Our dedicated educators guide each child with patience, compassion, 
    and creativity—laying the groundwork not just for academic success, but for confident, 
    caring individuals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   We understand that learning is most powerful when it is joyful. 
   Whether it’s through storytelling, music, hands-on discovery, or heartfelt conversations, 
   we make every moment count. At Little Hearts, we don’t just prepare children for school—we prepare them for life.
   I warmly invite you to visit us, meet our wonderful team, and witness the energy, warmth, 
   and love that fills our school every day.

          Hello there! I'm Ms Yoke Ping, 
          and I believe every child is a little star just waiting to shine. 
          ✨ I absolutely love bringing stories to life through dramatic play, 
          puppetry, and silly voices! Whether it's under our reading tree or 
          during circle time, I enjoy watching little eyes light up with 
          curiosity and wonder. With over 7 years of early childhood teaching experience, 
          I make it my mission to help children feel safe, seen, 
          and celebrated every single day.

        Hi! I'm Ms Eloise your friendly music and movement guide! 
        🎶 From ukulele sing-alongs to tapping rhythms on classroom drums, 
        I love using sound and dance to help children express themselves. 
        I’m passionate about creating a joyful, energetic space where kids can 
        explore feelings, teamwork, and creativity. 
        When I’m not in the classroom, you’ll find me composing silly songs 
        about dinosaurs and vegetables!
