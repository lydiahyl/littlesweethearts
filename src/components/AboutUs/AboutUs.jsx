              <p>Dear Parents and Families,</p>
              <p>Welcome to KinderHearts — where everything begins with heart.</p>

            Starting KinderHearts has been more than a professional journey — 
            it’s the realisation of a vision I’ve long carried: to create a space 
            where children feel safe, loved, and truly happy, and where parents feel 
            supported in their journey too. When school and home come together in love, 
            understanding, and purpose, beautiful things happen. Children thrive. 
            Children flourish.
            </p>
            <p>
            My journey in education — from teaching across Malaysia and abroad, in local, 
            private, and international schools, to leading preschools and engaging with diverse 
            communities — has shaped my understanding of what a nurturing school should be. 
            KinderHearts brings these insights together, blending global perspectives with local 
            values and effective practices.
            </p>
            <p>
            We believe the heart of education lies in the education of the heart. 
            At KinderHearts, learning is joyful, play is purposeful, and every detail — 
            from the classrooms to the playground — is thoughtfully designed with children’s 
            wellbeing in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
            We’re not here to reinvent the wheel, but to refine it. Through reflection, intention, 
            and heart, we strive to keep doing better — for the betterment of both teaching and learning.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is more than a school. It’s a warm, connected community, a family — where every child is seen, 
            every voice matters, and kindness leads the way. A place where parents can leave their children with 
            peace of mind, knowing they are loved, respected, and guided with care. A place where little hearts grow big dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
            Thank you for choosing KinderHearts and entrusting us with your precious little ones. 
            I look forward to walking this journey with you — hand in hand, heart to heart. 
            As you explore KinderHearts, I invite you to see not just what we do, but why we do it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Above all, I hope for KinderHearts to be our children’s safe, happy place — 
            filled with joyful memories and the colours of childhood they so deserve. 
            </p>

            At KinderHearts, we believe the heart of education is the education
            of the heart.
            <br /><br />
            Early childhood is the most critical period for nurturing minds,
            shaping values, and building the foundation for lifelong learning.
            Our preschool is a safe, joyful, and inspiring place where every
            child is known, loved, and supported to thrive in their own unique
            way.
            <br /><br />
            Here, children feel empowered to explore, encouraged to ask
            questions, and celebrated for who they are. With a nurturing
            environment and intentional teaching, we help children develop a
            strong sense of self, empathy for others, and a love for learning
            that lasts a lifetime.
