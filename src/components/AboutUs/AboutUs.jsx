    <h2>Principal's Message</h2>
      <p> At Little Hearts, we believe that early childhood is the most crucial stage 
      of developmentâ€”where young minds bloom with curiosity, imagination, and boundless potential. 
      Our preschool is built on a foundation of love, faith, and a deep respect for every childâ€™s unique journey.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We strive to provide a nurturing, joyful, and engaging environment where children feel safe, valued, 
    and excited to learn. Our dedicated educators guide each child with patience, compassion, 
    and creativityâ€”laying the groundwork not just for academic success, but for confident, 
    caring individuals.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   We understand that learning is most powerful when it is joyful. 
   Whether itâ€™s through storytelling, music, hands-on discovery, or heartfelt conversations, 
   we make every moment count. At Little Hearts, we donâ€™t just prepare children for schoolâ€”we prepare them for life.
   I warmly invite you to visit us, meet our wonderful team, and witness the energy, warmth, 
   and love that fills our school every day.

          Hello there! I'm Ms Yoke Ping, 
          and I believe every child is a little star just waiting to shine. 
          âœ¨ I absolutely love bringing stories to life through dramatic play, 
          puppetry, and silly voices! Whether it's under our reading tree or 
          during circle time, I enjoy watching little eyes light up with 
          curiosity and wonder. With over 7 years of early childhood teaching experience, 
          I make it my mission to help children feel safe, seen, 
          and celebrated every single day.

        Hi! I'm Ms Eloise your friendly music and movement guide! 
        ðŸŽ¶ From ukulele sing-alongs to tapping rhythms on classroom drums, 
        I love using sound and dance to help children express themselves.

        explore feelings, teamwork, and creativity.
